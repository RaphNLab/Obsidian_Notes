* A variable is an abstraction for a memory location: This means we use variables to name a memory area where information is stored. This memory location could change if we run the program again but since the name doesn't change we can still use it. The content of the variable may change also.
* It allows programmers to use meaningful names an not memory addresses (Since they can bring confusion)
* A variable has:
	* Type -Their category (integer, real number, string, Person)
	* Value - The content (10, 3.24, "Toto")
* Variable must be declared before they are used

# Declaring variables

* Variables can contain letters, numbers and underscores
* Must begin with a letter or underscore
* Cannot begin with a number
* Cannot use C++ reserved keywords
* Cannot re-declare a name in the same scope
* C++ is case sensitive

# Naming convention

Camel case can be used: The first character of each word shall be upper case (DayOfYear)
Underscore can be used: An underscore is used to separate each work of the variable name (buffer_index)
