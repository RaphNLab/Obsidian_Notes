# Introduction
TDD helps developer to write better code rather that applying Debug-Later Programming, TDD is used to increase the code modularity. Test are written a piece of core is written and test. If the test fails, we just need to undo the last change. This way we exactly know where the problems are located instead of using debugging sessions to find it out before correcting the bug.
There are several benefits for embedded Developers:
+ Fewer bugs
+ Less debug time
+ Fewer side effects
+ Progress monitoring
+ Rewards after each passing test
+ Improved design
